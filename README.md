# Car-Number-Plate-Detection-using-OpenCV
This was my First Project in Image processing in python using OPEN CV 
**SOME HIGHLIGHTS OF THIS PROHECT/ Description are:**
**Implementing a Car Number Plate Recognition System (ANPR) for Punjab, Pakistan using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is a complex task that requires multiple components, including image processing, character recognition, and training the neural network. It's beyond the scope of a single response to provide a full implementation, but I can give you a high-level overview of the process and suggest some third-party tools and libraries to help you get started.**

Here are the general steps involved in building an ANPR system:

Data Collection: Collect a large dataset of car number plate images from Punjab, Pakistan. This dataset should include various fonts, styles, and conditions (daylight, nighttime, different weather conditions, etc.).

Image Preprocessing: Preprocess the images to enhance the quality and remove noise. Common preprocessing steps include resizing, cropping, gray scaling, and applying filters for noise reduction.

Character Segmentation: Use techniques like edge detection and contour detection to separate individual characters on the number plate.

Character Recognition: Train an ANN to recognize characters using the segmented character images. You can use libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch for this. You'll need labeled data for training the neural network.

Text Recognition: After character recognition, you need to group recognized characters to form a complete number plate. This may involve using regular expressions or other methods to validate and assemble the characters.

Testing and Evaluation: Evaluate your ANPR system's accuracy, precision, and recall using a test dataset. Fine-tune your model as needed to improve performance.

Deployment: Integrate the ANPR system into your desired application or environment. This may involve creating a user interface and connecting it to cameras or video streams.

For specific tools and libraries to use:

For image preprocessing and manipulation, you can use Python libraries like OpenCV.

For character recognition, you can use deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a common choice for this task.

For text recognition and grouping, you can use regular expressions or libraries like Tesseract OCR.

You may also consider using pre-trained models or leveraging cloud-based ANPR services, as they can save a lot of development time.

Keep in mind that building an effective ANPR system is a non-trivial task, and it can be resource-intensive in terms of data, computational power, and expertise. It may be more practical to explore pre-built ANPR solutions or consider collaborating with experts in computer vision and machine learning if you're not experienced in these fields. Additionally, ensure you comply with legal and ethical considerations when implementing an ANPR system.
**Please if you have any project for me then let me know i providing paid project services as well.**
